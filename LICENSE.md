DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, COPY, OR USE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. If You do not agree to be bound by, or the entity for whose benefit You act has not authorized You to
accept, these terms and conditions, do not install, access, copy, or use the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in Your possession.

This SOFTWARE EVAUATION LICENSE AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is entered into between Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Intel”) and
You. “You” refers to you or your employer or other entity for whose benefit you act, as applicable. If you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind that legal entity to the
Agreement, in which case, "You" or "Your" shall be in reference to such entity. Intel and You are referred to herein individually as a “Party” or, together, as
the “Parties”.

You wish to evaluate certain experimental Intel-developed software directed to Object Sensing and Cognition for Adversarial Robustness (“Software”).

Intel wishes to grant You a limited license to evaluate the Software in connection with the DARPA GARD program.

The Parties, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which they acknowledge, and intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
1. PURPOSE. You seek to obtain, and Intel desires to provide You, under the terms of this Agreement, Software solely for Your internal efforts to test and
evaluate such Software.
2. LIMITED LICENSE. Conditioned on Your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to You a limited, nonexclusive,
nontransferable, revocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license during the term of this Agreement, without the right to sublicense, under Intel’s copyrights
(subject to any third party licensing requirements), solely within Your premises (for purposes of this Agreement, Your premises are deemed to include cloud
storage and computing infrastructure of third parties which is used by You to conduct Your business), only to display, perform and create derivative works
of the Software only for evaluation purposes in connection with the DARPA GARD program. Intel further grants to you the right to distribute the Software
to third party performers under the DARPA GARD program (“Performers”) that have a need to receive it to perform under such program, provided that You
so distribute the Software with a copy of this Agreement and promptly notify Intel in writing of any such third party to which You distribute the Software.
Intel further grants You the right to disclose to DARPA and Performers the results of Your evaluation of the Software for their use in performance of the
DARPA GARD program.
3. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. All right, title and interest in and to the Software are and will remain the exclusive property of Intel and/or Intel’s suppliers.
Unless expressly permitted under this Agreement, You will not, and will not allow any third party to (i) use, copy, distribute, sell or offer to sell the Software
or associated documentation; (ii) create derivative works from the Software except and only to the extent as specifically required by mandatory applicable
laws or any applicable third party license terms accompanying the Software; (iii) use or make the Software available for the use or benefit of third parties;
or (iv) publish any Software benchmark or comparison test results. You acknowledge that an essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that Intel
grants You no licenses or other rights including, but not limited to, patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, service mark or other intellectual
property licenses or rights with respect to the Software and associated documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses
expressly granted above. You acknowledges there are significant uses of the Software in its original, unmodified and uncombined form. You may not
remove any copyright notices from the Software.
4. OPEN SOURCE STATEMENT. The Software may include Open Source Software (OSS) licensed pursuant to OSS license agreement(s) identified in the
OSS comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header(s) provided with or otherwise associated with the Software. Neither You nor any
Original Equipment Manufacturing, Original Device Manufacturing, customer, or distributor may subject any proprietary portion of the Software to any OSS
license obligations including, without limitation, combining or distributing the Software with OSS in a manner that subjects Intel, the Software or any portion
thereof to any OSS license obligation. Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable OSS
license.
5. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Certain third party software provided with or within the Software may only be used (a) upon securing a license directly from
the software owner or (b) in combination with hardware components purchased from such third party and (c) subject to further license limitations by the
software owner. A listing of any such third party limitations is in one or more text files accompanying the Software. You acknowledges Intel is not providing
You with a license to such third party software and further that it is Your responsibility to obtain appropriate licenses from such third parties directly.
6. NON-CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Software and the Software’s associated
documentation are considered to be non-confidential, provided, however, neither Party may use the other Party’s name in any publications, advertisements,
or other announcements without such other Party’s prior written consent.
7. NO OBLIGATION; NO AGENCY. Intel may make changes to the Software, or items referenced therein, at any time without notice. Intel is not obligated to
support, update, provide training for, or develop any further version of the Software or to grant any license thereto. No agency, franchise, partnership, jointventure, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.
8. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. INTEL DOES NOT WARRANT OR ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION, TEXT, GRAPHICS, LINKS OR OTHER ITEMS WITHIN THE SOFTWARE.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL INTEL OR ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, OR LOST DATA) ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE,
EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
FOR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY IN PART NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE
SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING OR LIFE SUSTAINING SYSTEMS,
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, NUCLEAR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE
COULD LEAD TO PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THEIntel Confidential Information
LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL
AND YOU. YOU ACKNOWLEDGES INTEL WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.
10. TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL. The term of this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder shall end upon completion or termination of the DARPA
GARD program. Intel may terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty (30) days’ notice and immediately if You or someone acting on Your behalf
or at Your behest violates any of its terms or conditions. Upon termination, You will immediately destroy and ensure the destruction of the Software or
return all copies of the Software to Intel (including providing certification of such destruction or return back to Intel). Upon termination of this Agreement,
all licenses granted to You hereunder terminate immediately. All Sections of this Agreement, except Section 2, will survive termination.
11. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to it will be governed by the laws of the U.S.A. and
Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The Parties exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods (1980). The state and federal courts sitting in Delaware, U.S.A. will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts. A Party that obtains a judgment against the other Party
in the courts identified in this section may enforce that judgment in any court that has jurisdiction over the Parties.
12. EXPORT REGULATIONS/EXPORT CONTROL. You agree that neither You nor Your subsidiaries will export/re-export the Software, directly or indirectly,
to any country for which the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other agency or department of the U.S. Government or the foreign government from
where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining any such required license or approval. In the event
the Software is exported from the U.S.A. or re-exported from a foreign destination by You or its subsidiary, You will ensure that the distribution and
export/re-export or import of the Software complies with all laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations
and the appropriate foreign government.
13. ASSIGNMENT. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license(s) granted or any of Your rights or duties hereunder, expressly, by
implication, by operation of law, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without Intel’s express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign,
delegate and transfer this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and merge and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Neither
Party will be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect to the subject matter hereof other
than as expressly provided herein. In the event any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or applicable court
decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, instead such provision will be changed and
interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within legal limits.
15. WAIVER. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of any provision hereof will not affect the full right to require such performance
at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself.
